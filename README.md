# WeatherDemoSwiftUI
It's demo application written with SwiftUI and Combine

Known issues:
- TabView pager can have wrong position after display orientation change
- Trailing icons on WeatherDetails screen not aligned

What can be improved:
- URL builder should be rewritten on URLRequests with params to avoid problems with spaces in cities names
- Models can be parsed via "init(from decoder: Decoder)" to convert fields in needed Types
- Error handling on UI
- Unit tests can be extended
- DI Improvement
- Working with mocked data and placeholders
- Adding SpiteScene for cool snow/rain effects
- Design overlall:)
